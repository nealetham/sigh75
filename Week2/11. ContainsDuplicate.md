# Contains Duplicate

## Initial Solution

A dictionary is used to keep track of the numbers encountered in the array. If the number is already in the array, then there is a duplicate.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
  num_dict = {}
  duplicate = False

  for num in nums:
      if num in num_dict:
          duplicate = True
          break
      else:
          num_dict[num] = 1

  return duplicate
```

## Alternate Solution

Here is a more elegant solution which uses the properties of a set, where there are no duplicates. As such, we can just compare the length of the array, and its set counterpart.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
  return len(nums) != len(set(nums))
```
