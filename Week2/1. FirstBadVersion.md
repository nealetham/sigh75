# First Bad Version

## Initial Solution

In the problem, we know that after a certain index, all indexes after it is labelled as "bad", and all preceding it is "good". As such, we can model this as a array search problem, one where we use the Binary Search algorithm.

We use two pointers, which keeps track of the first and last index of the array. We iteratively repeat the search problem on the left if the current middle index has a "bad" value, and do so on the right if the current middle index has a "good" value. We have found the first bad version when we know that all index preceding the first pointer is "good" and all after the last pointer is "bad".

Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Space Complexity: O(1)

The number of calls to `isBadVersion` is log(n) times in the worst case scenario.

```python
def firstBadVersion(self, n):
  fp = 1
  lp = n

  while fp <= lp:
      mid = fp + (lp - fp)/2
      if isBadVersion(mid):
          lp = mid - 1
          continue
      fp = mid + 1

  return fp
```
