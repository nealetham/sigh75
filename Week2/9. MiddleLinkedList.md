# Middle Of the Linked List

## Initial Solution

This is another classic problem from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's Cracking the Coding Interview Handbook. We use the slow pointer and fast pointer method to solve this problem.

The intuition is that the slow pointer will always be in the middle of the head of the linked list and the fast pointer. As such, when the fast pointer has reached the end of the linked list, the slow pointer must be exactly in the middle of the linked list.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```python
def middleNode(self, head):
  slow = fast = head
  while fast and fast.next:
      fast = fast.next.next
      slow = slow.next

  return slow
```
