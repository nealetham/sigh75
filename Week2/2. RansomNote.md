# Ransom Note

## Initial Solution

This problem is one that is relatively simple. I maintained two list of characters which has characters from the ransomNote and the magazine. We iteratively check if the each character in the ransomNote is present in the magazine. If it is present, we remove it from the magazine to ensure no double counting of characters.

Time Complexity: O(nm)
Space Complexity: O(n+m)

Where n = length of ransomNote, m = length of magazine. Here I used a list, but a simple optimized solution would be to use a dictionary which will allow for O(1) lookup.

```python
def canConstruct(self, ransomNote, magazine):
  note = list(ransomNote)
  mag = list(magazine)

  while note:
      letter = note.pop()
      if letter in mag:
          mag.remove(letter)
          continue
      return False
  return True
```
