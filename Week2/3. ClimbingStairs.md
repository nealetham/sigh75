# Climbing Stairs

## Initial Solution

This is an obvious recursion problem. At each n, we can either take 1 step or 2 steps, that means it branches to 2 + (n-1) + (n-2). This branching continues until n = 0. However, we can first think about the base cases.

Base cases:

1. When n=1, only 1 action is possible, which is to take 1 step.
2. When n=2, 2 actions are available, which is to take 1 step, or 2 steps.

The recursive step is to acknowledge that only these two actions are possible, and we can just sum them up. However, this solution does not pass the test cases due to the amount of duplicated computation that the algorithm does.

```python
def climbStairs(self, n):
  if n == 1:
      return 1

  if n == 2:
      return 2

  return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)
```

## Improved Solution

Here, we build up on the initial solution by trying to add memoization to the solution.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
def climbStairs(self, n):
  memo = {}
  memo[1] = 1
  memo[2] = 2

  def recurse(n):
      if n in memo:
          return memo[n]

      memo[n] = recurse(n-1) + recurse(n-2)
      return memo[n]

  return recurse(n)
```
