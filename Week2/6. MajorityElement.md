# Majority Element

## Initial Solution

Here we maintain a dictionary of elements with its value as the count. For each element, we increment the count and check if the value exceeds the definition of majority value.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(m)

Where m is the number of unique elements in the array.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums):
  count = {}
  for val in nums:
      count[val] = count.get(val, 0) + 1

      if count[val] > len(nums) // 2:
          return val
```
