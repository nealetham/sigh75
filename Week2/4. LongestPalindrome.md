# Longest Palindrome

## Initial Solution

A palindrome is a string that is the same when read forward and backwards. Intuitively, that means that for each letter in the palindrome, it must occur in multiples of 2 (to account for the first half and second half), except for the middle character. I figured that the best way to keep track of this is using a dictionary with values as its occurrence in the original string.

We iterate through each character in the dictionary, checking for two conditions.

1. Count is multiple of 2 i.e module 2 = 0, then we add the character count to the length
2. Count >= 3 i.e. count // 2 = 0, then we can extract the number of multiples of two from the character count

Lastly, if we have left over letters not used, we can add 1 to account for a middle character.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s):
  letters = {}
  length = 0

  for letter in s:
      letters[letter] = letters.get(letter, 0) + 1

  for letter, count in letters.items():
      if count % 2 == 0: # even length can be added
          length += count
          del letters[letter]
          continue

      if count // 2 > 0:
          length += (count // 2) * 2
          letters[letter] -= (count // 2) * 2

  if len(letters) > 0:
      length += 1

  return length
```
