# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Initial Solution

Here I used a simple recursion with each recursive call we add 1, with indicates the height of the subtree. When the recursion unfolds, we choose the subtree that has the largest depth.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Suppose that the tree is lop-sided, where every child is on the right subtree, there will be n recursive calls.

```python
def maxDepth(self, root):
  def recurse(root):
      if root is None:
          return 0

      return max(recurse(root.left) + 1, recurse(root.right) + 1)

  return recurse(root)
```
