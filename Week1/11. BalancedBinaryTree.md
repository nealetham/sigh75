# Balanced Binary Tree

## Initial Solution

Instinctively, I used a recursive solution where with each node, we recursively calculate the height of the left subtree and the right subtree. At the leaf nodes we return a 0 which starts the unfolding of the recursion, and at any point where the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree differs by more than 1, we return a -1 to its parent node. The value then bubbles to the top (root node), where we can then check if its a balanced binary tree.

Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Space Complexity: O(log(n))

```python
def isBalanced(self, root):
  def height(root):
      if root is None:
          return 0

      left_subtree = height(root.left)
      right_subtree = height(root.right)

      if abs(left_subtree - right_subtree) > 1 or left_subtree == -1 or right_subtree == -1:
          return -1

      return 1 + max(left_subtree, right_subtree)

  return height(root) != -1
```
