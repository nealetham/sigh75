# Linked List Cycle

## Initial Solution

This is one of the classic problem that was listed in Gayle Laakmann McDowell's Cracking the Coding Interview Handbook. This solution is extracted from the handbook.

In order to check if a linked list contains a cycle, we can use a slow pointer and fast pointer. If there is an absence of a cycle, then the fast pointer would eventually reach the last node, where we can return false. Else wise, we need another termination condition, which is the fact that the fast pointer would ultimately "lap" the slow pointer and point towards the same node as the slow pointer. At that point, we know for a fact that it has a cycle, and we can return true.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```python
def hasCycle(self, head):
  slow = fast = head
  while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
      fast = fast.next.next
      slow = slow.next

      if slow == fast:
          return True

  return False
```
